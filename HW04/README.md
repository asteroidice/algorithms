# HW 04 Problem 5.3.10
## Prompt
Write a program for computing the internal path length of an extended binary tree. Use it to investigate empirically the average number of key comparisons for searching in a randomly generated binary search tree.

## Run the program
I've created an example program you can run using the following command.
```
python pathLength.py
```
## Interpreter mode
If you're feeling adventurous you can fiddle around with the tree by using the following command.
```
python -i pathLength.py
```
